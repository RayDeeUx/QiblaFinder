# QiblaFinder

Playing Geometry Dash just before prayer time? No more need to close the game in a panic!

Set your latitude and longitude coordinates in your mod settings, and let QiblaFinder do the math.

For the privacy-conscious, feel free to use [this web page](https://latlong.net/countries) and find the location closest to you to set your coordinates.

This mod makes use of the [AlAdhan API](https://github.com/islamic-network/api.aladhan.com) to calculate the direction you need to face towards Mecca.
