# QiblaFinder

Playing Geometry Dash just before prayer time? No more need to close the game in a panic!

Set your latitude and longitude coordinates in your mod settings, and let QiblaFinder do the math.

For the privacy-conscious, feel free to use [this web page](https://latlong.net/countries) and find the location closest to you to set your coordinates.

This mod makes use of the [AlAdhan API](https://github.com/islamic-network/api.aladhan.com) to calculate the direction you need to face towards Mecca.

## Heads up! (Privacy Policy)

QiblaFinder stores your latitude and longitude coordinates in its own mod settings. Other Geode mods may be able to access this information as they please.

<cy>To minimize the likelihood of other mods misusing this information, please use [this web page](https://latlong.net/countries) and find the location closest to you to set your coordinates.</c>

The AlAdhan API does not remember your latitude and longitude coordinates. While the AlAdhan API is aware of your latitude/longitude coordinates when performing the calculations, none of this information is stored for future use.

<cy>You are able to disable access to the AlAdhan API in the mod's settings. If API access is unavailable or if you disable API access in the mod settings, QiblaFinder performs local calculations instead.</c>

By installing/continuing to use QiblaFinder, you agree to these terms. To opt-out, simply disable or uninstall the QiblaFinder mod.

## Waiver of Liability

<cy>***QiblaFinder is not responsible for inaccurate calculations, regardless of AlAdhan API access status in your mod settings.***</c>
